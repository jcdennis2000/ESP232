# ESP232
=================================
ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers are great! They have built in WiFi, and Bluetooth for the ESP32, in a tiny package! However to program them they need to be put into a bootloader mode, but most programmers can’t do this for you. But now we have the ESPFlash standard!

The ESP232 uses the FTDI232 programmer, with the 1×6 0.1 inch ESPFlash convention. There is a 600mA power regulator on board, which can power the target device, and a USB B connector to connect to your computer.

For more information on the ESPFlash convention see the https://www.superhouse.tv/espflash/.

Features:

* ESPFlash header in 1×6 0.1inch format.
* 600mA 3.3V voltage regulator.
* Power, TX and RX LEDs.
* FTDI232 USB to Serial converter.
